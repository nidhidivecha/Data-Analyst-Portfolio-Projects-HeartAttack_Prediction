# HeartAttack_Prediction

**ðŸ”¹Domain: Healthcare**

**ðŸ”¹ About the Project**

Cardiovascular diseases(CVD) are the leading cause of death globally.
The purpose of the project is to identify the causes of HeartDisease and develop a system to predict heart attack in an effective manner. To analyze Heart data and construct a consolidated and interactive Tableau Report that will allow end users to quickly access the required data.

ðŸ”¸ **Steps**

**Preliminary Data Inspection:** 
Loaded the dataset/Examined the structure of the data (columns, data types)/Checked for missing values and duplicates.

**Data Cleaning:** 
Removed one duplicate value.

**Statistical Summary:** 
Calculated descriptive statistical measures (mean, median, mode)

**Performing EDA:** 
Analyzed and visualized the composition of overall patient's Heart disease vs Normal using a Count plot.
Plotted a Heatmap to find the Correlation between the target variable and other variables used in the dataset.
Studied the occurrence of CVD across different age groups.
Investigate the possibility of detecting heart attacks based on anomalies in resting blood pressure.
Studied the composition of overall patients with respect to gender using a Pie chart .
Described the relationship between Cholesterol Levels and Target Variable with the help of Bar plot.
Explored the relationship between peak exercising and the occurrence of a heart attack and visualized it using a Bar plot.
Investigated if thalassemia is a major cause of CVD using a Scatter plot..
Used pair plots to understand the relationship between all given variables and identify patterns.

**Data Modelling:** 

Used various models to predict outcomes for predicting heart attacks.

1)Logistic Regression
2)Decision tree classifier
3)Random Forest
4)K-nearest Neighbors(KNN)
5)Support Vector Classification(SVC)

**Model Evaluation:**

â€¢	Evaluated and validated results using the confusion matrix.

â€¢	Presented the performance metrics such as (Accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and support) and discussed the model's effectiveness.


**Conclusion**
From the observation, we can see that the KNN model performs better with an **accuracy score of 85%**.

ðŸ”¹ **Building Dashboard**

Designed interactive and dynamic dashboards using Tableau to understand attributes of a diseased vs. a healthy person.
