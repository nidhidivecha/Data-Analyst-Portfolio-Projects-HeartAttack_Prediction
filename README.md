# HeartAttack_Prediction

**ðŸ”¹Domain: Healthcare**

**ðŸ”¹ About the Project**

Cardiovascular diseases(CVD) are the leading cause of death globally.CVD are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, and they remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
The purpose of the project is to identify the causes of HeartDisease and develop a system to predict heart attack in an effective manner. To analyze Heart data and construct a consolidated and interactive Tableau Report that will allow end users to quickly access the required data.

ðŸ”¸ **Steps**

**Preliminary Data Inspection:** 
Load the dataset/Examine the structure of the data (columns, data types)/Check for missing values and duplicates.

**Data Cleaning:** 
Remove duplicates (if any)/Treat missing values using an appropriate strategy

**Statistical Summary:** 
Calculate descriptive statistical measures (mean, median, mode)

**Performing EDA:** 
Identify categorical variables and explore them using count plots.
Study the occurrence of CVD across different ages.
Investigate the possibility of detecting heart attacks based on anomalies in resting blood pressure.
Study the composition of overall patients with respect to gender.
Relationship between Cholesterol Levels and Target Variable:
Peak Exercising and Heart Attack Occurrence:
Investigate if thalassemia is a major cause of CVD.
Create a pair plot to understand the relationship between all given variables.

**Data Modelling:** 
1)Logistic Regression
2)Decision tree classifier
3)Random Forest
4)K-nearest Neighbors(KNN)
5)Support Vector Classification(SVC)


ðŸ”¹ **Building Dashboard**

Designed interactive and dynamic dashboards using Tableau to understand attributes of a diseased vs. a healthy person.
